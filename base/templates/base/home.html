                    <h4>How I Learn</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I learn through a variety of options like tutorials, Blogs, Official Documentation and also last but not the least i make projects related to whichever technology i learn. For better algorithms i prefer problem solving, many times i get stuck, i search the error, learn it and implement it accordingly.</p>
                    <p>I am more interest in debugging the algorithm where i get stuck instead of staring the code for hours.
                        I Don't hesitate to solicit from my mentors when needed.
